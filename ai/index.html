  <h1>10 Smart Ways to Use AI in Your Job Search</h1>
  <p>AI plays a growing role in how employers screen, select, and interview candidates — especially for mid-level and early-career roles. But job seekers can use many of these same tools to their advantage. This guide will help you understand where and how to use AI wisely, whether you're tailoring a resume or preparing for an online interview.</p>

  <h2>How to Pass the Initial Screen</h2>

  <h3>1. Read Job Descriptions Like a Search Engine Would</h3>
  <p>Most companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to filter resumes before a human ever sees them. These systems scan for alignment between your resume and the job post, looking for phrases, tools, and credentials that match.</p>
  <p>So read job descriptions with that in mind. What’s mentioned early or more than once? What tools, certifications, or soft skills are emphasized? These are your cues.</p>

  <h3>2. Mirror the Language from the Job Description</h3>
  <p>It’s not enough to say “great communicator” when the role asks for someone who can “facilitate cross-functional collaboration.” Employers want to hear their own language echoed back — it signals fit and attention to detail.</p>
  <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Job post:</strong> “Manage a product roadmap and coordinate GTM strategy”</p>
    <p><strong>Resume:</strong> “Led product roadmap execution and partnered with marketing on go-to-market planning”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>You're not copying and pasting — you’re translating your experience into their vocabulary.</p>

  <h3>3. Use AI to Tune Your Resume for a Specific Role</h3>
  <p>Paste your resume and a job post into a tool like ChatGPT and ask:</p>
  <blockquote>“What’s aligned, what’s missing, and where can I mirror the language more effectively?”</blockquote>
  <p>This can highlight overlooked strengths or show you where you’re not speaking the employer’s language — literally.</p>

  <h3>4. Know What an ATS Actually Does</h3>
  <p>An ATS extracts plain text from your resume and matches it against job requirements. It looks for structure, keywords, and relevance — not formatting creativity.</p>
  <p>To improve your odds:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use standard headers (“Experience,” “Education”)</li>
    <li>Avoid text boxes, graphics, or columns</li>
    <li>Submit in .docx or simple PDF</li>
    <li>Include relevant keywords from the job description</li>
  </ul>
  <p>According to Jobscan, 75% of resumes never get seen by a human due to poor ATS match or formatting errors.¹</p>

  <h3>5. Adjust LinkedIn Based on the Roles You’re Targeting</h3>
  <p>You don’t need to update LinkedIn for every job you apply to. But if you're consistently targeting a type of role — like product marketing or sales engineering — scan several job descriptions and look for patterns. Then update your headline and About section to reflect those phrases and priorities.</p>
  <blockquote><strong>Instead of:</strong> “Experienced B2B Marketer”<br />
  <strong>Try:</strong> “Product Marketing Manager | GTM Strategy | Customer Storytelling | Revenue Enablement”</blockquote>
  <p>This improves your visibility in recruiter searches and makes your story more cohesive to anyone checking your profile after reviewing your application.</p>

  <h2>How to Prep Once You’re Through</h2>

  <h3>6. Start with the Simplest Interview Practice: Record Yourself</h3>
  <p>You don’t need a fancy platform to improve your video presence. Use your webcam and answer questions aloud like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>“Tell me about yourself.”</li>
    <li>“Why this role?”</li>
    <li>“What’s an example of a time you led a project under pressure?”</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Then watch it back. Better yet, ask a friend or family member to watch and give you feedback on clarity, confidence, and presence.</p>

  <h3>7. Use Free AI Tools for Video Interview Practice</h3>
  <p>Many companies now use AI video interviews — platforms like HireVue or Modern Hire that record you answering timed questions. These interviews may be evaluated by algorithms based on voice, word choice, or pacing.</p>
  <p><strong>Before your first real one, try a practice platform:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Interview Warmup:</strong> Free. Gives feedback on your vocabulary, filler words, and topic coverage.</li>
    <li><strong>MyInterviewPractice:</strong> Free version offers timed practice questions and review.</li>
    <li><strong>Big Interview:</strong> Some free features, but full access usually requires a subscription or library/career center login. Paid tiers (~$79/month) offer more advanced coaching tools.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Free versions won’t score your body language or vocal delivery, but they will help you structure responses and build comfort on camera.</p>

  <h3>8. Expect AI Interview Prompts to Feel a Bit Unnatural</h3>
  <p>You might face 3–6 questions, with 30 seconds to prep and 1–2 minutes to respond — no human interviewer, just your webcam. These tools are designed to measure content (did you answer the question?), delivery (were you clear and concise?), and consistency (did your experience match your application?).</p>
  <p>The best prep is repetition — practice answering out loud using phrasing and priorities from the job description.</p>

  <h3>9. Structure Strong Behavioral Answers with STAR</h3>
  <p>Most video interview prompts are behavioral:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>“Tell me about a time you solved a complex problem.”</li>
    <li>“Describe a time you dealt with conflict at work.”</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Use the STAR method:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Situation:</strong> What was happening?</li>
    <li><strong>Task:</strong> What were you responsible for?</li>
    <li><strong>Action:</strong> What did you do?</li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> What happened as a result of your action?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Keep responses tight and concrete. Use specific examples from your resume, and reflect back the employer’s values when possible.</p>

  <h3>10. Use AI or Human Feedback to Polish Your Pitch</h3>
  <p>Once you’ve practiced, ask someone — or a smart AI tool — to review your responses. The goal: make sure your examples are relevant, well-structured, and clear.</p>
  <p>AI can flag filler words or help tighten your phrasing. A human can tell you if you're underselling yourself or rambling. Use both when possible.</p>
